- **Player vs AI (PvAI)**: Challenge the AI opponent

### Game Variants
- **Normal Nim**: The player who takes the last object **WINS**
- **Mis√®re Nim**: The player who takes the last object **LOSES**

### AI Algorithms
- **Nim-sum Calculation**: Uses XOR operations based on Sprague-Grundy theorem
- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimal move search with pruning optimization
- **Position Evaluation**: Strategic scoring of game states
- **Pattern Matching**: Recognition of winning/forcing positions
- **Endgame Strategy**: Specialized tactics for Mis√®re Nim endgames

### Strategy Helper
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get optimal move suggestions
- **Move Prediction**: See potential move sequences and counter-moves
- **Turn Management**: Practice with both first and second move orders
- **Position Evaluation**: Understand the mathematical principles behind optimal play

## üß† AI Strategy Explanation

### Normal Nim Strategy
The AI uses the mathematical concept of **Nim-sum** (XOR of all pile sizes):
- **Winning Position**: Nim-sum ‚â† 0 (can force opponent into losing position)
- **Losing Position**: Nim-sum = 0 (opponent has winning strategy)

### Mis√®re Nim Strategy
The AI switches strategy based on game state:
- **Early/Mid Game**: Play like Normal Nim
- **Endgame**: Special rules when few objects remain
  - With all single piles: Leave odd number for opponent
  - With one pile > 1: Reduce to create favorable single pile count

### Algorithm Complexity
- **Nim-sum Calculation**: O(n) where n = number of rows
- **Move Generation**: O(n√óm) where m = max objects in a row
- **Position Evaluation**: O(1) constant time
- **Pattern Matching**: O(n log n) due to sorting

## üéÆ How to Play Nim

### Basic Rules
1. Game starts with 4 rows containing 1, 3, 5, and 7 objects respectively
2. Players alternate turns
3. On each turn, remove any number of objects from a single row
4. The goal depends on the game variant:
   - **Normal**: Take the last object to win
   - **Mis√®re**: Force your opponent to take the last object

### Winning Strategy Tips

#### Normal Nim
- Try to leave positions where Nim-sum = 0
- Calculate: Row1 XOR Row2 XOR Row3 XOR Row4
- If result ‚â† 0, you can win with optimal play

#### Mis√®re Nim
- Play like Normal Nim until endgame
- In endgame, count piles with >1 object
- Leave odd number of single-object piles for opponent

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'"
```powershell
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# On CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install tkinter
# or
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install python-tk
```

#### Game Window Not Appearing
- Ensure you're running Python 3.7+
- Check if display is properly configured (for SSH/remote connections)
- Try running: `python -m tkinter` to test Tkinter installation

#### Performance Issues
- The AI calculations are optimized and should run smoothly
- If experiencing lag, ensure Python is updated to the latest version

### Supported Platforms
- ‚úÖ Windows 10/11
- ‚úÖ macOS 10.14+
- ‚úÖ Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 10+, CentOS 7+)
